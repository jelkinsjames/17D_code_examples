# Code Portfolio for 17D Application
This repository has several examples of code I wrote for both classes and for projects in my research project. 
There are examples of things I have written in Java, Python, SystemVerilog, Google Apps Script (JavaScript), and some C.

#Python

There are two examples for my Python code:

242L2 - This lab deals with convolution: how it works practically and conceptually. Completed as part of a group.

242L4 - This lab deals with audio filtering, demonstrating that my group fully grasped how to code for digital signal processing in python. Completed as part of a group.

#Java

Example 1 - My version of a Huffman Encoder/Decoder. This was the last project in my Computer Programming II class, and it demonstrates my knowledge of algorithms and functions to manipulate data.

Example 2 - A game of 20 Questions with a computer. Add any question/answer tree into the questions.txt, and the program will automatically create a QuestionNode tree that stores all the data given at initialization as well as during the game. Able to take user input whenever it gets the question tree wrong so that it can grow the tree.

#SytemVerilog

Example 1

Implements a 8x32 Ram which can be written to and read synchronusly on a FPGA HEX display.

Example 2

Same as above, except that it will continuously scroll through the memory depending on how fast the clock divider is set. Can change RAM anytime during memory scroll.

Example 3

Implements a oneCounter that counts the number of ones input on the switch array at the bottom of the FPGA and displays it on the FPGA HEX displays.

Example 4

Same as above but it counts the number of ones stored at an address in a 8x32 RAM.

#Google Apps Script

Move to Sandbox
My research lab, the Sensors, Automation, and Energy Laboratory, is unique for a university lab as it is very large and nearly all undergraduate students. These students are managed using a huge Kanban board system implemented in Google Sheets, which is powered by Google Apps Script. When I joined the lab, my first assignment was putting the code to move inactive students to the "Sandbox" where they would have to do tasks to get back into the main lab. This was pretty difficult, as I had never done any JavaScript or anything like it before, but my code laid the groundwork for the code that is still used. Benjamin, the other author on the doc, was my supervisor and helped me with the Slack API portion at the end. This was a difficult project but I learned a lot from it.

C

getPhoneNumber
Very simple program created as an example of incremental programming, where I created each brach of the if/else tree independently. I am currently in the C programming course for embedded systems, so I will be working on more complex programs soon.
