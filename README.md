# Code Portfolio for 17D Application
This repository has several examples of code I wrote for both classes and for projects in my research project. 
There are examples of things I have written in Java, Python, SystemVerilog, Google Apps Script (JavaScript), and some C.

Move to Sandbox
My research lab, the Sensors, Automation, and Energy Laboratory, is unique for a university lab as it is very large and nearly all undergraduate students. These students are managed using a huge Kanban board system implemented in Google Sheets, which is powered by Google Apps Script. When I joined the lab, my first assignment was putting the code to move inactive students to the "Sandbox" where they would have to do tasks to get back into the main lab. This was pretty difficult, as I had never done any JavaScript or anything like it before, but my code laid the groundwork for the code that is still used. Benjamin, the other author on the doc, was my supervisor and helped me with the Slack API portion at the end. This was a difficult project but I learned a lot from it.

C

getPhoneNumber
Very simple program created as an example of incremental programming, where I created each brach of the if/else tree independently. I am currently in the C programming course for embedded systems, so I will be working on more complex programs soon.
